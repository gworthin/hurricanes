# hurricanes

`Hurricanes.R` contains three separate analsyses on all recorded hurricanes in the United States. The `hur_state` dataframe is from the National Hurricane Center's [HURDAT2](https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/data/hurdat/hurdat2-format-nov2019.pdf) dataset.

The first analysis creates a map of the US showing the number of unique hurricanes that have made landfall in each state. The resulting map is `Map.png`
